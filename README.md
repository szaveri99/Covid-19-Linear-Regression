## Overview

This project focuses on COVID-19 data analysis in Europe. The primary goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), handle missing values and outliers, and create a linear regression model to predict total deaths based on various factors.

## Project Structure

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- **Code**: The R code for data analysis, data preprocessing, and modeling.
- **Data**: The COVID-19 dataset used for analysis ([OWID dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)).
- **README.md**: This README file.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Covid-19-Linear-Regression.git
```

2. Ensure you have R and the required libraries installed.

```R
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(funModeling)
library(naniar)
library(GGally)
library(corrplot)
```

3. Unzip the COVID-19 data file (`owid-covid-data.zip`) and place it in the "Data" folder.

4. Open and run the R script `covid_analysis.R` to execute the data analysis.

## Data Analysis

The project includes various stages of data analysis, including:

- Data loading and exploration.
- Missing values and outliers detection and treatment.
- Visualization of key data aspects.
- Creation of a linear regression model to predict total deaths.

## Results

The project's results are summarized as follows:

- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and outliers.
- Visualization of key variables and their relationships.
- A linear regression model for predicting total deaths based on various factors.
